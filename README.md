# Transcription factor target prediction and biological analyses

The repository stores files that were used to perform different
biological analysis with provided ChIP-seq sample data while
using R **Shiny** application. Furthermore, the repository
contains files that were used to implement method that predicts
transcription factor binding sites in target genome.

**Directory descriptions:**
- **Input/** - stores JSON file that defines R libraries,
  abbreviations, chromosomes and their lengths for each
  organism that can be analyzed using the app;
- **Intermediate_data/** - the folder contains folder
  **Generated_files** that stores intermediate peak annotation
  files that were generated by R script;
- **Scripts/** - contains **App/** folder that stores main
  *ui.R*, *server.R* and *app.R* scripts that are used to build
  *Shiny* app for ChIP sequencing data analysis. The folder also
  contains *TF_analysis.Rmd* program that implements transcription
  factor target prediction method. Moreover, a CSS file that defines
  app styles can be found in the folder.
