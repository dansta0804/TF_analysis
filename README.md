# Transcription factor target prediction and biological analyses

The repository stores files that were used to perform different
biological analysis with provided ChIP-seq sample data while
using R **Shiny** application. Furthermore, the repository
contains files that were used to implement method that predicts
transcription factor binding sites in target genome.

**Directory descriptions:**
- **Input/**.
- **Intermediate_data/**.
